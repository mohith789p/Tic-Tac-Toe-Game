# Tic-Tac-Toe (CLI)

## How to Play

- Players: Two players take turns. One is X, the other is O.
- Board: A 3×3 grid shown in the command-line interface. Each turn, place your symbol in an empty square.
- Goal: Get three of your symbols in a row — horizontally, vertically, or diagonally.
- Turn order: X usually goes first. Players alternate until someone wins or the board is full.

## Winning and Draws

- Win: If you place three of your symbols in a straight line, you win immediately.
- Draw: If all squares are filled and neither player has three in a row, the game is a tie.

## Simple Strategy Tips

- Start in the center when you can — it gives the most chances to make three-in-a-row.
- Block your opponent: if they have two in a row, place your symbol to stop them.
- Think one move ahead: consider how a move creates opportunities for both players.

## Variations

- Play best-of-three or best-of-five matches to reduce luck and reward strategy.
- Try switching who goes first each game for fairness.

## About the Game

This version is a simple command-line (text-based) game of Tic-Tac-Toe. It keeps the classic rules and quick play of the paper-and-pencil original while running in a terminal window. It's easy to learn, fast to play, and great for practicing strategic thinking. Games are usually short and perfect for casual play or deciding small decisions.
